# Setup variables using grains['osfinger'] based logic.
# You just need to add the key:values for an `osfinger` that differ
# from `defaults.yaml` + `osarch.yaml` + `os_family.yaml` + `osmap.yaml`.
# Only add an `osfinger` which is/will be supported by the formula.
#
# If you do not need to provide defaults via the `os_finger` grain,
# you will need to provide at least an empty dict in this file, e.g.
# osfingermap: {}
